**Funding:** BMFTR (funding number: 01ZZ2319G)\
**Project runtime:** 01.03.2024 - 30.04.2025

EyeMatics is a project that collects and analyzes clinical data from patients who have received "Intravitreal surgical drug application" IVOM therapy from various information systems in the clinics. Using a harmonized core data set, it combines information sources from four university hospitals (Aachen, Greifswald, Muenster and TÃ¼bingen) and from two rollout partners (Clinic Chemnitz and University Hospital Leipzig). The project uses established statistical methods and state-of-the-art artificial intelligence pattern recognition methods to identify new characteristic features of eye diseases and to examine their course during IVOM therapy.
