#PCOR-MII

Patient-Centered Outcomes Research in the
Medical Informatics Initiative - [PCOR-MII](https://pcor-mii.de/eng/)

**Funding:** BMFTR (Funding number: 01ZZ2321J)\
**Project runtime:** 01.03.2024 - 29.02.2028

The aim of PCOR-MII is to foster the collection of digital patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in the healthcare setting and to integrate them with other types of medical data - for example on diagnosis and therapy - to ultimately enable research on relationships between subjective and objective parameters for therapy success.
In May 2025, the project entered the second funding phase.
