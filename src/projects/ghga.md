# GHGA

The German Human Genome-Phenome Archive - [GHGA](https://ghga.de)

**Funding:** DFG (funding number: 441914366)\
**Project runtime:** 01.10.2020 - 31.12.2028

As a secure national omics data infrastructure, GHGA enables the use of human omics data in research, while ensuring data security and preventing misuse. By bridging the gap between research and healthcare, we drive the development of new therapies and diagnostics. 

To do so, GHGA takes a multilayered approach to data security, building advanced infrastructure and a ethics-legal framework for GDPR-compliant data processing, as well as enabling controlled, yet FAIR data access.

While being a consortium of the German National Research Data Infrastructure ([NFDI](https://www.nfdi.de/?lang=en)), GHGA is also embedded in European activities, such as the federated European Genome-Phenome Archive ([FEGA](https://ega-archive.org/about/projects-and-funders/federated-ega/)) and the European Genomic Data Infrastructure ([GDI](https://gdi.onemilliongenomes.eu/)).

## GHGA Data Portal
Launched on August, 1 2024, the Archive phase of the [GHGA Data Portal](https://data.ghga.de/) allows users to access data stored within GHGA Archive through a fully integrated data access management system. It also implements two-factor authentication via Life Science Login for users.  

The datasets within are annotated following the latest version of the [GHGA Metadata Model](https://www.ghga.de/resources/metadata-model), which is compatible with the metadata model of the EGA. 

The GHGA infrastructure is serviced by a federated network of seven data hubs. These are connected to local centers that are major producers of genomic data which will be integrated into GHGA. 

## genomDE model project

Within the [genomDE model project](https://www.bfarm.de/DE/Das-BfArM/Aufgaben/Modellvorhaben-Genomsequenzierung/_verteilerseite.html), GHGA provides the archiving and research platform for the generated genomic data, supporting the aims for earlier and more precise diagnosis and treatments tailored to the individual genetic profiles of patients.
