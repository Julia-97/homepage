#NUM-DIZ

Network of University Medicine - Data Integration Centres - [NUM-DIZ](https://www.netzwerk-universitaetsmedizin.de/en/research/num-diz)

**Funding:** BMFTR (funding number: 01KX2121)\
**Project runtime:** 01.01.2023 - 30.06.2025

The NUM-DIZ project builds on the preliminary work of the Medical Informatics Initiative ([MII](https://www.medizininformatik-initiative.de/en/start)), within which Data Integration Centres (DIZ) have been established at most German university hospitals with the aim of supporting data provision and cross-site data integration and analysis. As part of the NUM-DIZ project, the established DIZs are continuously expanding their service portfolio and tapping into new data sources, becoming essential service providers for many multi-site research projects.
